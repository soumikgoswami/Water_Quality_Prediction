 Water_Quality_Prediction:-This project provides a Python script for predicting water quality parameters using the `PB_All_2000_2021.csv` dataset. The code preprocesses the data by correctly handling the semicolon delimiter, extracting year and month features from the date column, removing the 'id' column, and most importantly, dropping rows with missing values in the target water quality measurements. It then trains a `MultiOutputRegressor` using `RandomForestRegressor` and evaluates its performance with MSE and R2 scores, offering a ready-to-run solution in environments like VS Code after installing `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scikit-learn`.
