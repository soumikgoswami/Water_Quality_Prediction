 Water_Quality_Prediction:-This project is designed to develop and evaluate a machine learning model for predicting water quality parameters. The notebook begins by ensuring all necessary libraries are installed and imported, including `pandas` for data manipulation, `numpy` for numerical operations, `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization, and `scikit-learn` for machine learning functionalities. Key components from `scikit-learn` imported are `MultiOutputRegressor`, `RandomForestRegressor`, `train_test_split`, `mean_squared_error`, and `r2_score`, clearly indicating a regression task focused on multiple target variables.
The core functionality involves loading a water quality dataset, `PB_All_2000_2021.csv`, which contains various parameters such as NH4, BSK5, Suspended solids, O2 levels, NO3, NO2, SO4, PO4, and CL, along with an ID and date for each entry. After loading, the notebook likely proceeds with data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, which is crucial given that some columns (e.g., NH4, Suspended, O2) show non-null counts less than the total entries. The primary objective is to train a `RandomForestRegressor` within a `MultiOutputRegressor` framework to predict these water quality attributes. Finally, the model's performance is evaluated using `mean_squared_error` and `r2_score` to assess its accuracy and predictive power.
